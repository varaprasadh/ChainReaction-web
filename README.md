# Chain Reaction For WEB

Chain Reaction is a strategy game for 2 to 8 players in which you must gain access and eliminate others players atoms.Coloured atoms are placed by players in turns one after the other.

Corner cells can accommodate maximum of one atom .

Edge/side cells can accommodate maximum of two atoms.

Other cells can accommodate maximum of three atoms.

If you try to insert an extra atom than capacity of cell,it explodes giving adjacent cells one atom each and colour of adjacent cell atoms will be changed to yours.If adjacent cells are already full then they will in turn explode and chain reaction will continue until all cells are stable.

A player may only place their atoms in a empty cell or a cell that contains atoms of their own colour.When the player loses all their atoms,they are out of game.The one who stands till last is winner.

Excellent sound effects and animation.
